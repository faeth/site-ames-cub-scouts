      <p>
        Cub Scouting is a fun way to spend time with your child and the whole family. The fun has a purpose:  to help reinforce the positive values you want your child to develop---character, leadership, personal fitness, and citizenship. These values are presented in a fun and engaging method along with experiencing the outdoors, learning about personal safety, and discovering your family traditions.
