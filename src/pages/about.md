Cub Scouts is one of the few activities you get to enjoy with your kids. Go on a hike, enjoy a campout with other families, work on a car for the Pinewood Derby race, learn about nature, and go on many more adventures together.

Cub Scouts is for boys and girls in Kindergarten through 5th grade, and their parents.
